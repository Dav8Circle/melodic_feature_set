# Melodic Feature Set

This is a Python package designed to facilitate the use of many different melody analyis tools. 

The main goal of this package is to consolidate a wide range of features from the computational melody analysis literature
into a single place, in a single language.

Included in the package are contributions from:
- FANTASTIC (Müllensiefen, 2009)
- SIMILE (Müllensiefen & Frieler, 2006)
- melsim (Silas & Frieler, n.d.)
- jSymbolic2 (McKay & Fujinaga, 2006)
- IDyOM (Pearce, 2005)
- MIDI Toolbox (Eerola & Toiviainen, 2004)
